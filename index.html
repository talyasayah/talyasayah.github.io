            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi I am Talya Sayah a 10th grade student at Hisar School. I am eager to increase my computer science background and so have taken the CS50 Understanding Technology course and are enrolled in the Introduction to Computer Science course. This course has been an eye-opening experience for me, providing a solid foundation in programming, algorithms, and problem-solving skills.</p>
            <p>With this new knowledge, I am excited to dive deeper into the world of computer science by taking the Computer Science Principles AP. I am eager to explore more advanced topics, work on new projects, and continue learning to enhance my skills further.</p>
            <p>I am currently learning swift!</p>
